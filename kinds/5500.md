# Input

Clients must provide a URL in the <code>"i"</code> tag field. The desired file(s) to be scanned must be directly accessible at the provided URL.

# Output

If no malware was found, `content` is set to the string `CLEAN`. If malware was found, `content` contains plaintext with details of findings.

In order to help with discoverability/search, service providers should include an `x` tag set to the SHA256 of the scanned file(s).
